The Seeker is seeking an algorithm for accurate, reproducible, and automatic identification and characterization of peaks in two-dimensional time series data. The data may be simple and contain a small number of fully resolved peaks or may be complex and contain hundreds (to thousands) of overlapping peaks that may or may not be fully resolved with baselines that may or may not fluctuate across the timeline. Algorithms must identify the start, end, and apex of each peak.

A Polymer infrared spectrum is used as a calculus basis, being x axis wavelength in cm-1 and y axis transmitance in %.

The wavelength varies from  400 to 4000 cm-1.

The method is efficient even if baseline fluctuates.
